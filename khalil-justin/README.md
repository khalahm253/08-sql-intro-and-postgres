# Lab 08 - SQL and POSTGRES

**Author**: Khalil and Justin
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This is a blog site that stores articles in a database in which the user can read, or update a blog article. The home page features the most recent articles. 

## Getting Started
As a user, I want to store my articles in a database so that my articles are available for users from an external source.

## Architecture
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, Node.js to interact with our database and server. 

## Change Log
